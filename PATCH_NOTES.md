# M3.25 — Natural Conversation with Memory (m3.25-conversational)

**What changed**
- Natural conversation with proper memory: LLM handles warm, empathetic conversation while maintaining structured data extraction
- Fixed extraction loops: System prompt includes explicit examples preventing "I just told you!" scenarios 
- Conversational JSON format: Single LLM response contains both natural reply_to_user and structured extracted data
- Memory-aware responses: System remembers previous answers and never asks for same field twice
- Warm acknowledgments: Natural responses like "That sounds really useful!" and "You're absolutely right - sorry about that!"

**Why**
- Previous extraction-only approach felt robotic and couldn't handle conversational memory
- Users got frustrated with system asking same question repeatedly when they'd already answered
- Needed natural conversation flow while maintaining structured data collection for project planning

**Expected behavior**
- Warm, natural responses that remember what users said
- Progress through required fields (idea → audience → features → privacy → auth → deep_work_hours) without loops
- Proper handling of clarification requests and "I already told you" situations
- Empathetic acknowledgment of user input before progressing to next field

**Deploy**

```bash
supabase functions deploy cp-chat --no-verify-jwt --project-ref <YOUR_PROJECT_REF>
```

**Testing**
1. "It's a todo list for my family" → extracts idea and audience, asks for features naturally
2. "I just told you!" → acknowledges mistake and moves forward appropriately  
3. Natural conversation flow with memory and empathy throughout
4. No extraction loops or robotic repetition
